1: My final project will be a 3d D&D dice roller, allowing players to select the dice they want rolled, how many, and then generates those dice, and rolls them, displaying on the object the number that was rolled. Each dice will be a random, non-total white color base to the form, with the number displayed be the  color's opposite (For a blue die, orange numbers). There will be a 6-sided, 8-sided, 12-sided and 20 sided dice. As a stretch goal, I plan to first add a 4-sided die, as it is more challenging numbering it; I plan to add a base 4-sided, but not fully implement use of it until I do this stretch goal; also, another stretch goal would be adding a 10-sided die, as 10-sided are formed different compared to the others.


2:
Week 1: Locate platontic object file, and study three.js
Week 2: Start locating the code necessary to render and texture the dice.
Week 3: Start implementing the code that spawns the dice, as well as spacing them for multiple dice, sizing them to be legable, and to have different dice chosen to be roled together.
Week 4: Build the start-up area, with the base type of dice displayed, and a 6 sided rotating on one vertice, as if it was spinning on the ground.
Week 5: (Stretch Goal) Add the numbers towards the point of the 4-sided die, and start building the 10-sided.


3: I'll be creating a web-application using three.js and platotonic solid.obj file.
